I am writing to kindly follow up regarding my relieving/experience letter. As I had voluntarily resigned and my last working day was 24th June 2025, my new employer is requesting this document to complete my onboarding formalities.  

Could you please share an update on when I can expect to receive it? If possible, I would really appreciate it if you could help expedite this process.  

Please let me know if you need any further details from my side.  

Thank you very much for your continued support and assistance.  

Best regards,
